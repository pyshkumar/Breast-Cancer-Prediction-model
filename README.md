# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-model
A breast cancer prediction model implemented using Sklearn python package.

## Overview 
Objective is to train a ML model, which can the classify the breast Cancer cells,that whether it is malignant or benign.
Using 30 features, on which breast cancer cells are classified either cancerous or not, and using these features we have to classify cancer type.
Benign.: These are not cancerous. They either cannot spread or grow, or they do so very slowly. If a doctor removes them, they do not generally return.
Malignant : Malignant tumours are cancerous. The cells can grow and spread to other
parts of the body

## Libraries Used
● Sklearn python library
● Seaborn python library
● Pandas python library
● Numpy python library
● Mathpltlib python library

## Dataset
Some Dataset are taken from the UCI Maachine learning repository.

## Methodology
1. Pre-processing of the dataset.
2. Splitting of the data into train and test dataset.
3. Training the train dataset using various models.
4. Predicting using the test dataset on the trained model.
5. Comparing the accuracy of the various models.

## Observation
SVM was able to show its power in terms of effectiveness and efficiency based
on accuracy and recall.
